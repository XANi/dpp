How client works:
0a. check if dpp_repo_dir is valid repo, if not try to download it, if failed log warning and loop
0b. check if puppet_repo_dir is valid repo, if not clone from dpp
0c. check if remote origin for puppet_repo_dir is set to dpp_repo_dir
1. Check remote server for repo head hash
2. If it's different from last one (on startup it always pulls repo), pull, if not wait and go to p.1
3. Run puppet config checks, if failed log error and go to p.1
4. Run pre-puppet hooks (like etckeeper)
5. Run puppetd --test
6. Run post-puppet hooks
7. Log succes/failure of given commit
8. Go to 1
